    "readme": "# decorators\n\nThis package defines a conservative set of decorators intended for use in both\nNodeJS and web browser projects.  We recognize that decorators have certain risks:\n\n- They can inject hidden code at runtime, causing confusion for developers who\n  expected the source code to follow conventional semantics\n\n- They can be difficult to debug, since decorators are evaluated at load time\n  (versus compile time or run time)\n  \n- They can affect API contracts in subtle ways, which may cause unforeseen\n  breaks for runtime versioning (e.g. when loading a subclass that was compiled\n  against an older version of a base class with decorators)\n\n- The decorator spec is still evolving, and there may be breaking changes\n  in the future\n\nIn this light, the **@microsoft/decorators** package provides a small set of\ndecorators that stay within the conventional semantics of the TypeScript language.\nThe intent is to document API contracts more clearly and catch common mistakes,\nNOT to provide an open-ended toolkit of creative macros.  (If you are looking\nfor that, there are many other options, for example the\n[core-decorators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-decorators) project.)\n\n\n*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx),\nwhich is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences\nfor [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).\nFor more information, including complete API documentation and code samples, please visit\nthe [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx) web site.*\n"
