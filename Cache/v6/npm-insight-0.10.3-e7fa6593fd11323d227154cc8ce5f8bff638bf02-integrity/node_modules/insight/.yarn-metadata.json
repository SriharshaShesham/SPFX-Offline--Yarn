Future plans include refactoring to work with GA set up for app-based tracking and the [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).\n\nFor debugging, Insight can track OS version, Node.js version, and version of the app that implements Insight. Please set up custom dimensions per below screenshot. This is a temporary solution until Insight is refactored into app-based tracking.\n\n![GA custom dimensions screenshot](screenshot-ga-custom-dimensions.png)\n\n\n## Collected Data\n\nInsight cares deeply about the security of your user's data and strives to be fully transparent with what it tracks. All data is sent via HTTPS secure connections. Insight provides API to offer an easy way for users to opt-out at any time.\n\nBelow is what Insight is capable of tracking. Individual implementation can choose to not track some items.\n\n- The version of the module that implements Insight\n- Module commands/events (e.g. install / search)\n- Name and version of packages involved with command used\n- Version of node.js & OS for developer debugging\n- A random & absolutely anonymous ID\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Google Analytics\n\n```js\nconst Insight = require('insight');\nconst pkg = require('./package.json');\n\nconst insight = new Insight({\n\t// Google Analytics tracking code\n\ttrackingCode: 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X',\n\tpkg\n});\n\n// Ask for permission the first time\nif (insight.optOut === undefined) {\n\tinsight.askPermission();\n}\n\ninsight.track('foo', 'bar');\n// Recorded in Analytics as `/foo/bar`\n\ninsight.trackEvent({\n\tcategory: 'eventCategory',\n\taction: 'eventAction',\n\tlabel: 'eventLabel',\n\tvalue: 'eventValue'\n});\n// Recorded in Analytics behavior/events section\n```\n\n### Yandex.Metrica\n\n```js\nconst Insight = require('insight');\nconst pkg = require('./package.json');\n\nconst insight = new Insight({\n\t// Yandex.Metrica counter id\n\ttrackingCode: 'XXXXXXXXX'\n\ttrackingProvider: 'yandex',\n\tpkg\n});\n\n// Ask for permission the first time\nif (insight.optOut === undefined) {\n\tinsight.askPermission();\n}\n\ninsight.track('foo', 'bar');\n// Recorded in Yandex.Metrica as `http://<package-name>.insight/foo/bar`\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### Insight(options)\n\n#### trackingCode\n\n**Required**<br>\nType: `string`\n\nYour Google Analytics [trackingCode](https://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1008080) or Yandex.Metrica [counter id](http://help.yandex.com/metrika/?id=1121963).\n\n#### trackingProvider\n\nType: `string`<br>\nDefault: `google`<br>\nValues: `google` `yandex`\n\nTracking provider to use.\n\n#### pkg\n\n##### name\n\n**Required**<br>\nType: `string`\n\n##### version\n\nType: `string`<br>\nDefault: `'undefined'`\n\n#### config\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: An instance of [`conf`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf)\n\nIf you want to use your own configuration mechanism instead of the default `conf`-based one, you can provide an object that has to implement two synchronous methods:\n\n- `get(key)`\n- `set(key, value)`\n\n### Instance methods\n\n#### .track(keyword, [keyword, ...])\n\nAccepts keywords which ends up as a path in Analytics.\n\n`.track('init', 'backbone')` becomes `/init/backbone`\n\n#### .trackEvent(options)\n\nAccepts event category, action, label and value as described in the [GA event tracking](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events) documentation via the options object. Note: Does not work with Yandex.Metrica.\n\n```js\n.trackEvent({\n\tcategory: 'download',\n\taction: 'image',\n\tlabel: 'logo-image'\n});\n```\n\n##### category\n\n**Required**<br>\nType: `string`\n\nEvent category: Typically the object that was interacted with (e.g. 'Video').\n\n##### action\n\n**Required**<br>\nType: `string`\n\nEvent action: The type of interaction (e.g. 'play').\n\n##### label\n\nType: `string`\n\nEvent label: Useful for categorizing events (e.g. 'Fall Campaign').\n\n##### value\n\nType: `integer`\n\nEvent value: A numeric value associated with the event (e.g. 42).\n\n#### .askPermission([message, callback])\n\nAsks the user permission to opt-in to tracking and sets the `optOut` property in `config`. You can also choose to set `optOut` property in `config` manually.\n\n![askPermission screenshot](screenshot-askpermission.png)\n\nOptionally supply your own `message` and `callback`. If `message` is `null`, default message will be used. The callback will be called with the arguments `error` and `optIn` when the prompt is done and is useful for when you want to continue the execution while the prompt is running.\n\n#### .optOut\n\nReturns a boolean whether the user has opted out of tracking. Should preferably only be set by a user action, eg. a prompt.\n\n\n## License\n\nBSD-2-Clause Â© Google\n",
