It doesn't figure out if dependencies are met, it doesn't\nmutate package.json data objects (beyond what\n[read-package-json](http://npm.im/read-package-json) already does), it\ndoesn't limit its search to include/exclude `devDependencies`, or\nanything else.\n\nJust follows the links in the `node_modules` hierarchy and reads the\npackage.json files it finds therein.\n\n## Symbolic Links\n\nWhen there are symlinks to packages in the `node_modules` hierarchy, a\n`Link` object will be created, with a `target` that is a `Node`\nobject.\n\nFor the most part, you can treat `Link` objects just the same as\n`Node` objects.  But if your tree-walking program needs to treat\nsymlinks differently from normal folders, then make sure to check the\nobject.\n\nIn a given `read-package-tree` run, a specific `path` will always\ncorrespond to a single object, and a specific `realpath` will always\ncorrespond to a single `Node` object.  This means that you may not be\nable to pass the resulting data object to `JSON.stringify`, because it\nmay contain cycles.\n\n## Errors\n\nErrors parsing or finding a package.json in node_modules will result in a\nnode with the error property set.  We will still find deeper node_modules\nif any exist. *Prior to `5.0.0` these aborted tree reading with an error\ncallback.*\n\nOnly a few classes of errors are fatal (result in an error callback):\n\n* If the top level location is entirely missing, that will error.\n* if `fs.realpath` returns an error for any path its trying to resolve.\n",
